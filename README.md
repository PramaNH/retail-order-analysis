# Retail Orders Analysis

## Overview
This project explores and analyzes a retail orders dataset using SQL and Python in Jupyter Notebook. The primary goal is to perform data exploration, uncover meaningful insights, and visualize the data for decision-making purposes.

The analysis focuses on:
- Understanding trends in sales and orders.
- Identifying top-performing categories and regions.
- Comparing metrics across different timeframes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project comes from Kaggle:  
[Retail Orders Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitbansal06/retail-orders). It contains information about orders, categories, sales, and related attributes.

## Key Components

### 1. **SQL Exploration**
The SQL script (`data_exploration.sql`) includes queries for:
- Summarizing sales data by category, region, and time periods.
- Ranking top-performing categories by sales.
- Comparing yearly and monthly sales trends.

### 2. **Python Analysis**
The Jupyter Notebook (`orders_data_analysis.ipynb`) demonstrates how to:
- Load and preprocess the data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.


## Usage

To replicate this analysis:
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the analysis:
   jupyter notebook notebooks/orders_data_analysis.ipynb

2. Execute the SQL queries using your preferred SQL engine.
